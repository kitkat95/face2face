## Here's how it works:

If a user reacts with a Facebook emoji to a given article on Facebook, they will be paired with a Facebook user that reacted conversely and be given the option to speak anoymously with that person about why they felt the way they did about the given article. Articles may be of any nature, from controversial to benign.
